# Lingo
Final Year Software Development Project - Andrew Carroll 
<h1> Description </h1>
 <p> For my final year project in 3rd Year Software Development, I decided to create a mobile application named "Lingo" that allowed a user to send an SMS message to another person in a different language that they have selected. The Application was developed using the Ionic framework  with AngularJs & Cordova </p>
